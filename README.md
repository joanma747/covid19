# Create a MiraMon Map Browser with COVID-19 data using python
This repository collects some Python codes to transform some open data (World, Spain and Catalonia) about COVID 19 into embedded objects in a config.json that configures the MiraMon Map Browser. I use these codes every day to regularly update this map: http://datacube.uab.cat/covid19/

The codes combine the capacity to read CSV, transform it into GeoJSON and manipulate sections of a preexisting JSON file (config.json)
